### Background

DOMiNodesClicker is a clicker game that counts how many times you can click on
the white circles before time is up. The theme of the game is "Domino's Pizza" as DOMiNode is a
play on words. The main purpose of DOMiNodes Clicker is to be
a live example of the DOMiNode library that I have created, which is a library similar
to jQuery that is focused specifically on DOM Manipulation. A link to the repo below.
